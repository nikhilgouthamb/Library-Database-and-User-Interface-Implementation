# Library Management System

Well, this is a 2000+ lines of code, the amount of errors i got, the time i spent to search for functions 
which are spread across the field is inexplicable. Should spend some tie in organizing the code from now on. 

This is a course project as a part of "Data Management Systems Design", I have zero hands on experience on SQL, 
So i guess its a perfect project for folks like me to learn


For folks, who wanna try this project, lemme tell you a starter step from my experience, 
after creating the tables, POPULATE the tables, that's one important yet basic step i missed which put me in misery during the testing phase. 


Tbh, should've gone with CLI(which achieves the same result with fewer lines of code), Its a learning curve
